    "### ->When we run Python code, it goes through two processes: `compilation` and `interpretation`. The first process is the `compilation`, where Python converts the code into a format called `bytecode`. This bytecode is not meant to be read by humans, but instead by a `virtual machine` called the `Python virtual machine (PVM)`. The second process is `interpretation`, where the `PVM` executes the `bytecode` line by line, which produces the final output. This process is hidden from the user and happens automatically.\n",

The memory manager also provides tools such as the `del` statement and the `weakref` module for `manual memory management`. Python's memory management system is designed to make it easy for developers to write efficient code without manual memory management, but it's still important to be mindful of memory usage."
