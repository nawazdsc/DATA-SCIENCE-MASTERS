    "### Q1) What are the characteristics of the tuples? Is tuple immutable?\n",
    "->Tuples are an ordered collection of elements, typically written as a comma-separated sequence of values enclosed in parentheses. The characteristics of tuples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordered: The elements in a tuple are ordered, which means that they have a specific position or index in the tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable: Tuples are immutable, which means that once a tuple is created, its contents cannot be changed. This is in contrast to lists, which are mutable and can be modified after creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heterogeneous: Tuples can contain elements of different data types, including numbers, strings, and other tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashable: Tuples are hashable, which means that they can be used as keys in a dictionary or as elements in a set."

    "#### count_of_4 = my_tuple.count(4)\n",
    "#### print(count_of_4)  # Output: 3\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples have only two built-in methods (count and index) compared to lists because tuples are immutable, and many of the list methods modify the list in place, which is not possible with tuples. Since tuples are not intended to be modified once created, they do not need as many methods as lists. Additionally, tuples are often used to represent fixed collections of data, and so the two built-in methods are usually sufficient for working with them."

    "Q5) What is a dictionary? Give an example. Also, state whether a dictionary is ordered or unordered.\n",
    "\n",
    "->In Python, a dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is associated with a value. Dictionaries are implemented as hash tables, which provide fast lookups and insertions, making them a very useful data structure.\n",

    "\n",
    "* print(fruits['banana'])  # Output: 'yellow'\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dictionaries are unordered, which means that the order of the keys may not be the same as the order in which they were added to the dictionary. However, starting from Python 3.7, dictionaries are guaranteed to maintain the insertion order. So, in modern versions of Python, the order in which keys are added to a dictionary is maintained. Nonetheless, it is important to note that the primary functionality of a dictionary is not based on its order. Instead, the keys are used to quickly and efficiently look up values."
